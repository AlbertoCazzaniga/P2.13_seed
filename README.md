# P2.13_seed 

# Deep Learning

The information on this course is still a bit incomplete,
we will make updates during the course.

### Main Topics

- Artificial neural networks
- Train, validate and test a deep learning model
- Convolutional neural networks
- Brief remarks on unsupervised models

- Natural Language Processing
- Transformers and contextual word embeddings
- PyTorch, SpaCy and Hugging Face libraries

# Teachers

- Alessio Ansuini (AREA Science Park)
- Cristiano De Nobili (SAMSUNG)

Follow-up

- Piero Coronica (University of Cambridge)

# Detailed Syllabus (First Part by Alessio Ansuini UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

Here I will attach references of materials that inspired each of the arguments I touched upon

- Day 1

- Day 2 

- Day 3


# Exam

The exam will consist in an exploration of a recent finding on network pruning
called "The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis"

Other information will be added soon


# Videos

In order to see a video I suggest to download it (otherwise only shortened previews are available)

# Resources

There are excellent free resources to deepen your knowledge
on topics such as Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and more
in general Artificial Intelligence.

Here is a selection of a few of these. This selection will
be updated in the next days/weeks.
